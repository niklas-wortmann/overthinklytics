# JetBrains Booth Demo Scenarios

This document contains two end-to-end, narrative demo scenarios you can run from this repository during a live JetBrains booth session. Each scenario is written as a story with a clear workflow and a list of ‚Äúsurround‚Äù features to sprinkle in while talking and navigating the IDE.

The scenarios are designed to work with the pre-configured Run/Debug configurations included in this repo (see README). They require no custom environment variables by default.

- Scenario A: AI Misalignment Debt ‚Äî Generate tests with AI, then reveal subtle misalignments and fix them using the IDE‚Äôs debugging, refactoring, and test tooling.
- Scenario B: Intelligent Development Environment ‚Äî Showcase JetBrains Database tools + AI integration with refactorings, quick-fixes, live templates, code vision, and multi-language navigation across the monorepo.

Tip: Keep the JetBrains AI Assistant panel open and the Database tool window docked. Toggle the Services tool window to show running processes for dramatic effect.

## Scenario A ‚Äî AI Misalignment Debt

### Story
You shipped fast with AI scaffolding a small analytics endpoint and tests. A week later, guardrail tests expose a mismatch: the AI treated the reporting window as end-inclusive and counted internal ‚Äútest‚Äù events as billable. One test passes that shouldn‚Äôt; another fails. A quick debug session confirms the off-by-one and filter gap. You extract and rename the intent (`isBillableEvent`), fix the predicate (end is exclusive; exclude test/internal), update tests, and commit‚Äîthe misalignment debt is paid down.


### What we‚Äôll touch in the repo
- Kotlin backend: `apps/kotlin-backend/src/main/kotlin/com/overthinklytics/analytics/` (e.g., `AnalyticsController.kt`, `AnalyticsService.kt`)
- Django backend (Python): `apps/django-backend/django_backend/...`
- Next.js API (optional): create or use a minimal handler under `apps/overthinklytics/src/app/api/...`
- Next.js frontend (optional glance): `apps/overthinklytics`
- Tests per tech:
  - Kotlin: `apps/kotlin-backend/src/test/kotlin/...`
  - Django: `apps/django-backend/**/tests.py` or `tests/` package; run via `uv run manage.py test`
  - Next.js: component/API tests via Vitest/Jest in `apps/overthinklytics/src/**/__tests__/**`

### Workflow (step by step)

Kotlin/Spring path
1) Open the service code
   - Navigate to `apps/kotlin-backend/src/main/kotlin/com/overthinklytics/analytics/service/AnalyticsService.kt`.
   - Use Code Vision/Structure to explain responsibilities.
2) Ask AI to generate unit tests
   - Invoke JetBrains AI Assistant on `AnalyticsService` ‚Üí ‚ÄúWrite unit tests‚Ä¶ Kotlin + JUnit 5.‚Äù (TODO check in example test)
3) Run and debug
   - Run tests; observe mismatch. Debug with breakpoints, Watches, Smart Step Into.
5) Fix misalignment
6) Re-run and commit

Python/Django path (TODO dry-run)
1) Open the view/service code
   - Navigate to your analytics view/service in `apps/django-backend/django_backend/...` (e.g., a DRF view or service function handling event aggregation).
2) Ask AI to generate unit tests
   - With the target function/class selected, ask AI: ‚ÄúWrite concise Django unit tests (pytest/unittest) for empty input, off-by-one window, and category filters.‚Äù
3) Create the test file
   - Save as `apps/django-backend/django_backend/tests/test_analytics.py` (or within an existing app‚Äôs `tests.py`).
4) Run and debug
   - Terminal: `cd apps/django-backend && uv run python manage.py test`.
   - Use the IDE test runner and Debug to step through; set breakpoints in the view/service.
5) Fix misalignment
   - Extract a helper (e.g., `is_billable_event`) in Python; enforce end-exclusive window and exclude `test/internal`.
6) Re-run and commit
   - Tests pass; commit the fix with a clear message.

## Scenario B ‚Äî Intelligent Development Environment (IDE) with DB Plugin + AI

### Story
Support asks for clearer insights by device and OS. In one JetBrains environment, you add `device_id` and `os` to the device-share table via the Database tool, validate, and apply. You thread those fields through Kotlin services/DTOs (default `os = "unknown"` when missing) and accept quick refactorings. In the Next.js UI, you pass optional device/OS filters and let TypeScript quick‚Äëfixes propagate types. You run end‚Äëto‚Äëend and use AI to summarize risks (null handling, defaults, indexing on `os, device_id`).

### What we‚Äôll touch in the repo
- Database: Prisma/SQLite demo DB at `prisma/dev.db` (seeded via scripts in README)
- Kotlin backend: `apps/kotlin-backend/...`
- Django backend: `apps/django-backend/django_backend/...`
- Next.js API (optional): `apps/overthinklytics/src/app/api/...`
- Next.js frontend: `apps/overthinklytics/...`
- Run configurations: ‚ÄúKotlin Demo‚Äù, ‚ÄúNext Demo‚Äù (or per‚Äëapp Nx scripts)

### Workflow (step by step)
1) Explore the current schema and data (common)
   - Open the Database tool window; connect to `prisma/dev.db`.
   - Browse tables and DDL. Ask AI: ‚ÄúSuggest how to add `os` to the device share model.‚Äù

Then follow one of the backend paths:

Kotlin/Spring path (TODO: Dry-run)
2) Plan and apply the schema change
   - In the DB console, draft and apply:
     - `ALTER TABLE DeviceShare ADD COLUMN os TEXT;`
   - Refresh DB tree; inspect sample rows.
3) Propagate through Kotlin backend
   - Update DTOs and queries to include `os`
4) Wire into Next.js frontend
   - Add `os` to client calls; accept TS quick‚Äëfixes to propagate types.
5) Run end‚Äëto‚Äëend
   - Use ‚ÄúKotlin Demo‚Äù to start backend + frontend. Visit `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`.
6) Review
   - Run tests; Inspect Code; ask AI for risk summary (null/defaults, indexing).

Python/Django path (TODO: Dry-run)
2) Plan and apply the schema change
   - Apply the same SQL in the DB console to `events` (or adjust to your Django model/table name).
3) Propagate through Django backend
   - Update serializers/views/services to accept optional `os`.
   - Default `os` to `"unknown"` if missing; surface filters in the endpoint.
   - Add unit tests in `apps/django-backend/django_backend/tests/test_analytics.py`.
   - Run with `cd apps/django-backend && uv run python manage.py test`.
4) Wire into Next.js frontend
   - Ensure the frontend calls include optional `deviceId`/`os` when Django is selected.
5) Run end‚Äëto‚Äëend
   - Start Django (`uv run manage.py runserver`) + Next.js (‚ÄúNext Demo‚Äù). Visit `/dashboard`.
6) Review
   - Use AI Assistant to summarize changes and potential risks.

Next.js API path (TODO: Dry-run)
2) Plan and apply the schema change
   - Apply the same SQL in the DB console; Update the Schema Next.js API will read these fields directly.
3) Implement/adjust API route
   - In `apps/overthinklytics/src/app/api/analytics/route.ts`, include `os` in queries/aggregation; default `os` to `"unknown"`.
   - Add Vitest/Jest tests for device/OS filters.
4) Wire into Next.js frontend
   - Since backend = Next.js, client calls hit `/api/...`; add optional filters and propagate TS types.
5) Run end‚Äëto‚Äëend
   - Use ‚ÄúNext Demo‚Äù to serve the app; open `/dashboard` and try device/OS filters.
6) Review
   - Ask AI to propose indexes (e.g., on `(os, device_id)`) and edge cases.

### Surround scenarios/features to sprinkle in

  - Diff DDL before/after. Generate SQL script from model changes. Diagram view of tables.
  - Data editor conveniences: inline edits, filter rows, export to CSV.
- Cross-language navigation
  - From SQL/Prisma to Kotlin/Django usages; from Kotlin/Django to TS types; Search Everywhere/Recent Files.
- Refactorings and quick-fixes

  - Intentions like ‚ÄúAdd missing enum entries‚Äù or ‚ÄúCreate function from usage.‚Äù
- TypeScript/React ergonomics
  - Propagating types via quick-fixes; Component extraction.
  - ESLint + Prettier integration; Organize imports.
- AI Assistant value-adds
  - Generate migration script explanations for code review.
  - Propose test cases and edge conditions for device/OS logic.
- Performance and profiling (bonus)
  - Use HTTP client scratch file to hit backend endpoints.
  - Built-in profiler or HTTP timings view to compare responses.

## Practical tips for the live demo
- Use the repo‚Äôs Quick Start (see README: prisma generate/seed) before the booth opens.
- Keep one failing test prepared (rename it with a üö® emoji or comment) to quickly trigger the misalignment moment.
- Pin the Database console and AI Assistant tool windows.
- Practice the ‚Äúone-sentence takeaway‚Äù per step so you can bail out at any time and still land the message.
- Have the compound Run configurations ready: ‚ÄúKotlin Demo‚Äù and ‚ÄúNext Demo.‚Äù

## One-sentence takeaways
- Scenario A: AI can accelerate, but it also introduces misalignment debt‚ÄîJetBrains makes that debt visible, measurable, and cheap to pay down.
- Scenario B: The IDE is your intelligent development environment‚Äîdatabase to backend to frontend‚Äîwith AI as a helpful co-pilot, not a replacement for judgment.
